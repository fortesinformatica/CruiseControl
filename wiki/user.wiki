h2. Notes

Users do not need to belong to a group. If they are not in a group then they may still receive emails when they have committed changes that are part of the current build, depending on the setting of "modifierNotificationTypes" and the state of the build.  
See the section on the <converters> setting for manipulations that can be done to transform a user name to an address if the address is not specified.  
{warning}
It is essential that the value of the name attribute matches the name for the user in the sourcecontrol system. This is the only way that CruiseControl.Net can reconcile the user that committed a change with the address to send the email to.
