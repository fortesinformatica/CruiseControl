h2. Notes

{warning}
Up to CC.NET version 1.4.4, notification is a single attribute on the group. Starting with CC.NET 1.5.0, this has been changed to an array of notification types. From 1.5.0 onwards, the Failed notification type, is just failed, it does not include the Exception anymore. Making it possible to mail Exception to the buildmaster, and Failed to the developpers. Developers will not get Exception mails, unless configured so.
