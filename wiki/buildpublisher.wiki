h1. Build Publisher

The Build Publisher lets you copy any arbitrary files on a  *successful* build.  
You can set alwaysPublish to true, if you want the copy always to happen.  


h2. Version

Available from version 1.0

h2. Examples

{code:xml|borderStyle=solid|titleBGColor=#ADD6FF|title=Minimalist example}
<buildpublisher />
{code}
This will copy the contents of the project's working directory to a new label subdirectory under the project's artifact directory (i.e. <artifact\_dir>\<label\_dir>)  
{code:xml|borderStyle=solid|titleBGColor=#ADD6FF|title=Full example}
<buildpublisher>
  <sourceDir>C:\myprojects\project1</sourceDir>
  <publishDir>\\myfileserver\project1</publishDir>
  <useLabelSubDirectory>false</useLabelSubDirectory>
  <alwaysPublish>false</alwaysPublish>
</buildpublisher>
{code}
This will copy the contents of  *C:\myprojects\project1* to the network share   *\\myfileserver\project1*.
