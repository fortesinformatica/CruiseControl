h1. FAKE - F# Make Task

Runs a FAKE \- F# Make script.
"FAKE \- F# Make" is a build automation system. Due to its integration in F#, all benets of the .NET Framework and functional programming can be used, including the extensive class library, powerful debuggers and integrated development environments like Visual Studio 2008 or SharpDevelop, which provide syntax highlighting and code completion.
