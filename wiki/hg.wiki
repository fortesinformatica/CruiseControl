h2. Notes

You need to make sure your hg client settings are such that all authentication is automated. Typically you can do this by using anonymous access or appropriate SSH setups if using hg over SSH.  
You can link the modifications detected by CruiseControl.NET to the appropriate hgweb page by adding the following additional configuration information to the Mercurial source control section by using the [Mercurial Issue Tracker URL Builder].
