h1. Email Publisher

Publishes results of integrations via email.  This implementation supports plain\-text, and Html email formats. Rules regarding who receives email are configurable.  
The email publisher can be used to send email to any number of users. It is common to include one user who gets an email for every build and then also send email to every developer who checked code in for this build.  
{tip}
People tend to prefer to use [CCTray] rather than email for instant notification these days.  
{tip}
{warning}
Make sure that all of the Merge Publishers, along with the [Xml Log Publisher] task are done before the <email> publisher, or else you won't be able to include output from the build in the email. A common mistake is to put the email task in the <tasks> section instead of the <publishers> section. If an error occurs in the <tasks> section, the remaining tasks in that section are skipped, and CC.Net goes right to the <publishers> section. So if you put the <email> tasks in the <tasks> section, you'll never get any failure messages.

h2. Notes

h4. HTML E\-mails
When includedDetails = True, the message body will contain more information. This detailed information is constructed from xsl transformations on the build log. If the xslFiles section is filled these files will be used, if not defined the xls files are defined in the ccnet.exe.config in the xslFiles section. (see also: [Server Application Config File]). When adjusting one of these, restart the console/service.  
The benefits of defining the xsl files in the email publisher:  
* the xsl files are automatically the same for the console as for the service (no more keeping these 2 in sync)  
* it is possible to give projects different xsl transformations  
{warning}
The groups node may be empty, but the group section must exist.  
{warning}
h4. GMail
For sending mail via gmail :  
* mailhost="smtp.gmail.com"
* mailport="587"
* mailhostUsername="xxx.yyy@gmail.com"
* mailhostPassword="yourpassword"
* useSSL="TRUE"
