h1. MSBuild Task

The <msbuild> task is used to execute MsBuild projects, which are the default project format for Visual Studio 2005 projects and can also be compiled by using the MSBuild application that ships with the .NET 2 Framework.  
In order to work with the results of MsBuild it is important to use a custom xml logger to format the build results. For details on this, and a tutorial on how to use the task, see [Using CruiseControl.NET with MSBuild].  
{tip}
To see build progress information in the CCNet 1.5 WebDashboard remove the "/noconsolelogger" argument.
