h1. Parallel Task

Runs a set of child tasks in parallel. Each task will run at the same time as the other tasks.  
To run a set of tasks in sequential order within this task, use the [Sequential Task].  


h2. Version

Available from version 1.5

h2. Examples

{code:xml|borderStyle=solid}
<parallel>
  <tasks>
    <!-- Tasks defined here -->
  </tasks>
</parallel>
{code}

h2. Notes

The following is an example of how to combine this task together to the [Sequential Task] to run multiple 'streams' of tasks in parallel:  
{code:xml|borderStyle=solid}
<parallel>
  <tasks>
    <sequential>
      <description>First parallel stream.</description>
      <tasks>
        <!-- First sequence of tasks-->
      </tasks>
    </sequential>
    <sequential>
      <description>First parallel stream.</description>
      <tasks>
        <!-- Second sequence of tasks-->
      </tasks>
    </sequential>
  </tasks>
</parallel>
