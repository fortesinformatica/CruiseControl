h2. Notes

2 projects in CCNet  
1) is a project that does the compile, test, ... stuff, and also writes the modifications using the ModificationWriterTask be sure to set the appendTimeStamp of the modificationWriter to true  
2) is a project that deploys the result of project 1  
\-\-> copies it to other servers, updates source control (binary references like a framework), ...  
The reason for a second project is that this can be done on releases of milestones of project 1  
The ModificationReaderTask can now easily read the modification file(s) made by project one, into it's own integration, making it possible that these can be used by the existing tasks/publishers of ccnet for project 2  
It is best to place the modificationreader in the prebuild section, so all the other tasks / publisers know the read modifications also.  
It is adivisable to keep these configuration elements of the modificationWriter and the modificationReader the same.
