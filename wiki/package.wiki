h1. Package Publisher

Generates a ZIP file package containing the specified files.  
This will generate a "package" of files in a compressed format. The files must be specified, plus an optional manifest can be included.  
This publisher also allows the generation of a "manifest" to include in the package. A manifest contains additional details on the package, both at a general level and at a file level.
