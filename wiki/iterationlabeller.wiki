h1. Iteration Labeller

The Iteration Labeller is similar to the [Default Labeller]; however, it maintains a revision number that is incremented by one for each iteration from the release start date. For example, if the release start date was June 1, 2005 and the iteration duration was 2 weeks, the iteration number on July 1, 2005 would be 3. This would create a label of <prefix>.3.<build number>.
