h2. Notes

h4. Find Statement
For people not familier with Regex, here are some examples:
* Assert position at the beginning of a line (at beginning of the string or after a line break character): «^»
* Match any single character that is not a line break character: «.»
* Between zero and unlimited times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed (greedy): «\*»
* Match the regular expression below and capture its match into backreference number 1: «(CCNET.?\d)»
* Match the characters "CCNET" literally: «CCNET»
* Between zero and one times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed (greedy): «?»
* Match a single digit (i.e. 0..9): «\d»
* Assert position at the end of a line (at the end of the string or before a line break character): «$»
* Check without case sensitivity: «(?i)»h4. Replace Statement
To reference a backreference use « *$1*».
