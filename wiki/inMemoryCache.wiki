This cache stores sessions in the current instance of CruiseControl.Net. When CruiseControl.Net is restarted the sessions will be lost.  
{warning}
If you have Watch Config File = true (ccservice.exe.config: /configuration/appSettings/add\[key='WatchConfigFile'\] ), whenever a configuration change is detected, the service will be restarted and all sessions will be lost.  If you want sessions to persist across service restarts, use [File Based Security Cache].
