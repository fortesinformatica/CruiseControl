h1. Force Builder Publisher

The ForceBuildPublisher forces a build on a local or remote build server. It uses .NET Remoting to invoke a forced build on the CruiseControl.NET server at the specified URI.  
The forced build runs asynchronously, i.e. the ForceBuildPublisher does not wait for the forced build to finish. The ForceBuildPublisher is a great way to help [ Splitting the build ].  
An alternative to the ForceBuildPublisher is the [Project Trigger]. The main difference is that the ForceBuildPublisher is placed in the configuration for the primary project, while the ProjectTrigger is is placed in the configuration for the dependent project.
